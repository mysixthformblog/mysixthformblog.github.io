# Art course work research
##### _Kale Champagnie, year 12_
This document records my research into relevent cultral and artistic movments relevent to my year 12 course work project.

### Overview
Prior to research, I first took time to think about various ideas surrounding the theme of perception; broadly divided into topics such as _differing views of reality_, _emotional effects of weather_, _appearance of objects in dim light_ and _dreams_, as well as the notion of _'hive minds'_; exploring how unbound connectivity, and access to media can shape one's outlook on life.

### World views on reality
The nature of reality is question as old as our own existance and hence has yeilded millions of differing views in answer, some more compatible than others. As such, I decided to divide this vast array of beliefs into overall catagories and focus on specific examples from each. This included, pantheism, monothism, and nihalism
