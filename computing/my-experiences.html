<h3><a id="What_sparked_my_interest_3"></a>What sparked my interest?</h3>
<p>During the summer term of year six, our class was introduced to the brilliantly made <strong><em>Scratch</em></strong>, a visual programming language which allows users to build anything from small animations to entire games all simply by connecting certain instruction and logical blocks together. Unknown to me at the time, learning Scratch would become principal in teaching me creative, problem solving and mathematical skills required for real world computer programming.</p>
<p>After using Scratch for over a year - creating various, games, experiments and interactive animations, I speculated that Scratch itself must also be programmed in some way… but how?. Hence my quest for knowledge and skills regarding computer programming and later computer science began. Ever since that day I have learned, practiced a number of programming languages, scripting languages, markup languages. Although, I, for some reason am not satisfied with my current level of knowledge which is one reason A-level computer science appeals to me. Currently, I am beginning to focus research on particular fields, such as cyber security and networking and as such have purchased a number of large books regarding those subjects. Originally starting with software, I am less knowledgeable of electronics (in depth), and therefore have also bought a huge book titled “The Indispensable PC Hardware Book”. As well as individual programming languages, I am also competent using a number of development tools such as the DOS command prompt, Unix/Linux BASH (Bourne Again Shell), Git, GitHub, Atom (a hackable text editor), Vim (Vi Improved text editor), Eclipse IDE, Python IDE (IDLE), Google Firebase (dynamic hosting for web apps and related services) and GDB (a popular linux debugger). The following section summarises my experiences.</p>

<p>Apart from those shown above, I also have understanding and practical skills in other topics surrounding modern app design, linux kernel and OS distros, file systems, TCP/IP protocols, network security and ethics, network components (clients, servers, routers, hubs, switches, proxies…), compilers, linkers/loaders, low level programming, RAM segments (stack, heap, data, text, bss…), algorithms and computational efficiency/complexity, data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees),neural networks (the basics).</p>
